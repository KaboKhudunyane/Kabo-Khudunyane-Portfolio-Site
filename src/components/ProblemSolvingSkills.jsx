        <h2>Evidence of Problem Solving Skills</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Situation:</strong> In one of my software engineering courses, our final project required us to develop a web application that could manage and analyze large datasets. 
          Early in the project, our team encountered a significant challenge with data processing efficiency.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Task:</strong> My task was to identify the bottleneck in the data processing workflow and implement a solution to enhance performance without compromising accuracy.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Action:</strong> I conducted a thorough analysis of our existing codebase and identified that the data parsing function was inefficient. I researched various algorithms and implemented a more efficient parsing algorithm. Additionally, I optimized our database queries and used caching mechanisms to reduce redundant data processing.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Result:</strong> These improvements resulted in a 50% reduction in data processing time. Our web application could handle larger datasets more effectively, and we received high praise from our professor for our innovative problem-solving approach.
